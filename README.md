# Report Templates

The purpose of this project was initially to define a series of templates for different report formats, which would be easy to access, customize, and adapt, in order to optimize the development of similar reports. However, new functionalities, new objects, and new approaches have gradually been integrated into it.

Currently, this project contains three code units designed to simplify the implementation of resources and processes that are, in principle, more complex; as well as two enumerations of global variants that, together with these code units, optimize certain aspects of development.
